# Introduction to Cybersecurity

## What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; extorting money from users; or interrupting normal business processes.

## Key Concepts

### CIA Triad
- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring that information is not disclosed to unauthorized individuals
- **Integrity**: Maintaining the consistency, accuracy, and trustworthiness of data
- **Availability**: Ensuring that information and resources are available to authorized users when needed

### Common Threats
1. **Malware**: Malicious software including viruses, worms, and ransomware
2. **Phishing**: Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information
3. **DDoS Attacks**: Overwhelming a system with traffic to make it unavailable
4. **Man-in-the-Middle**: Intercepting communication between two parties

## Basic Security Principles

1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
2. **Least Privilege**: Users should have only the permissions they need
3. **Separation of Duties**: Critical tasks should be divided among multiple people
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep all software and systems updated

## Practice Exercise

Try to identify security vulnerabilities in a simple web application. What would you look for?
